# Digital Image Processing Task
This is a project that my university tasked a long ago. The goal is to detect faces by using the Haar Cascade Classifier approach, blur them, add watermarks to specific frame intervals, and put an overlay video on top of the main video.
Image manipulations are done using the OpenCV library.
